 ethic_authoritarian:0 "Elitism"

 ethic_fanatic_egalitarian:0 "Egalitarian"

 ethic_fanatic_xenophobe:0 "Xenophobe"
 ethic_fanatic_xenophobe_desc:1 "§LWe have already been exploring the starry sea at great risk, and any confusion and unknowns are vastly exaggerated by suspicion.

 ethic_xenophile:0 "Pluralism"
 ethic_xenophile_desc:0 "§LEnthusiasm cannot be extinguished, compassion for the weak, mutual help, and the ability to become friends with people of any civilization. Even if this relationship has been betrayed thousands of times, this is still our greatest wish.§!\n"

 ethic_spiritualist:0 "Spiritualism"
 ethic_spiritualist_desc:1 "§LThe entire world of life and culture are mere expressions of the spirit, far beyond the narrow confines of the term \"material,\" which fails to encompass them fully.

 ethic_fanatic_spiritualist:0 "Clericalism"
