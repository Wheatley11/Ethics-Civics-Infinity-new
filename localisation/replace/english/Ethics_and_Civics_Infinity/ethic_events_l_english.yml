 eci_event.10.name:0 "Yellow Miracle: The Rise of Cultural Monsters"
 eci_event.10.desc:0 "On our information network, an alien animation produced by a folk animation company has attracted widespread attention. The protagonist of this work is an extraterrestrial creature called the \"Yellow Bellied Star Clan\", with a rough appearance, a single skin color, and an almost repulsive yellow appearance. Its monotonous and boring plot and unrestrained \"borrowing\" have caused widespread confusion among adult audiences. Many people believe that this is just low-level entertainment created simply to follow the trend, but what surprises them is that children in our country are extremely fond of this strange alien creature.\n\nEven though the aesthetic value and artistic depth of this work have been criticized, it has rapidly spread among children and become a hot topic in the entire society and culture. The author's online community not only promotes this animation on a large scale, but also calls on the education sector to take it seriously, believing that it can help cultivate alien friendly awareness and promote positive acceptance of alien life.\n\nThe rapid popularity of this animated character has sparked widespread controversy, with half of the netizens expressing disgust towards the roughness of the work, believing that this vulgar alien image seriously lowers the cultural taste of civilization and may even lead to a regression in future citizens' artistic aesthetics."
 eci_event.10.a:0 "Continue to promote."
 eci_event.10.a.tooltip:0 "Despite the controversial quality, we can still promote this animation on a large scale. This work has established a favorable impression and interest in extraterrestrial civilizations among the younger generation, and is a positive attempt at future cultural exchange."
 eci_event.10.b:0 "Adjust the content."
 eci_event.10.b.tooltip:0 "Collaborate with cultural institutions and authors to modify the content of the animation, incorporating more complex and profound alien settings to enhance the artistic and serious quality of the work, and prevent children's aesthetic from falling into vulgarity."
 eci_event.10.c:0 "Prohibition of promotion."
 eci_event.10.c.tooltip:0 "We should take immediate action to prohibit these vulgar works from continuing to pollute the spiritual world of children."

 eci_event.20.name:0 "Brain Revolutionaries"
 eci_event.20.desc:0 "With the continuous efforts of the Chinese government, the use of the internet and social media is becoming increasingly popular. In these virtual spaces, more and more radical leftists and self proclaimed socialist theorists are beginning to speak out and propose some idealized ideas for social and economic systems. These propositions not only contradict the current political and economic system in our country, but also conflict with our current values and governance theories. However, these voices have not been effectively suppressed by the government and have instead gained some support among young people.\n\nThey criticize the cooperation between the government and enterprises, question the existing economic model, advocate strengthening the state's control over the means of production, and even propose a complete change in the market economy structure. However, as the rhetoric became increasingly intense, more and more citizens began to feel uneasy, especially when some radicals began openly questioning the legitimacy of the country's leadership, national security mechanisms, and government, the situation began to become dangerous.\n\nThese constantly expanding new socialist ideologies on the internet are widely referred to as \"Brain Revolutionaries\" - a sarcastic term referring to self proclaimed theorists who seem to only make empty comments online. Most normal citizens in our country, especially those neutral groups who value practicality and stability, have begun to feel that their presence poses a threat to social stability. Even worse, some extremist groups have begun to take action in the real world, organizing rallies, attacking government institutions, and even threatening the safety of some high-level government personnel."
 eci_event.20.a:0 "Fully suppress \"brain revolutionaries\"."
 eci_event.20.a.tooltip:0 "Faced with increasingly rampant radical leftist forces, we have decided to take tough measures. Strengthen the censorship of social networks, close channels for the spread of extreme speech, and shut down social accounts of radical individuals. At the same time, the use of force to suppress demonstrations and arrest the primary instigators of violence. By implementing strict political purges, we can completely eliminate the threat of this phenomenon and restore social order."
 eci_event.20.b:0 "Accept a certain degree of freedom of speech."
 eci_event.20.b.tooltip:0 "In the face of this situation, we do not want to see bloodshed and sacrifice, so it is necessary to respond to the public's anxiety with more moderate policies. Engage in dialogue with radical groups and explore what they perceive as revolutions in certain areas, such as further strengthening social welfare and promoting public ownership. To prevent the escalation of violent incidents, the government has promised to strengthen the protection of freedom of speech, but set necessary boundaries within the legal framework to avoid the further spread of extremist ideas."
 eci_event.20.c:0 "Completely abandon repression."
 eci_event.20.c.tooltip:0 "In order to avoid any form of conflict, we have decided to completely lift speech restrictions and allow radical leftists to develop freely. The government will focus on improving social security and people's livelihoods, supporting more free discussions and intellectual collisions, in order to find a more suitable social model through extensive social dialogue."

 eci_event.30.name:0 "Unknown False Accounts"
 eci_event.30.desc:0 "A large state-owned enterprise in our has engaged in serious accounting fraud during its long-term operation. The senior management of the company concealed its financial losses by falsifying accounts and transferred funds to private accounts overseas through complex cross-border transfer channels. In the end, this series of illegal transactions and financial operations were exposed by the media, triggering strong public reactions. This scandal not only involves internal corruption within state-owned enterprises, but also involves regulatory negligence by government officials, which has had a great impact on the country's economic reputation."
 eci_event.30.a:0 "Punish the mastermind behind the scenes."
 eci_event.30.a.tooltip:0 "We should immediately initiate a comprehensive investigation into the state-owned enterprise and its senior management, and hold those responsible legally accountable. The public demands a severe crackdown on corruption and the restoration of corporate credibility. Please note that the investigation may reveal more insider trading and fund transfers involving senior management."
 eci_event.30.b:0 "Conduct partial rectification."
 eci_event.30.b.tooltip:0 "Conduct partial rectification of the enterprise, temporarily dismiss relevant senior positions, and carry out limited reforms and audits. Although this can quickly calm public anger, the lack of a thorough crackdown on corrupt behavior may lead to unpredictable consequences."
 eci_event.30.c:0 "Downplay the impact of the event."
 eci_event.30.c.tooltip:0 "Downplay the impact of the scandal, minimize exposure and investigation, emphasize that this incident is a \"case problem\" of individual enterprises, and continue to support the development of state-owned enterprises. Turning a blind eye to corrupt practices can restore economic growth and market confidence in the short term, but the public may be dissatisfied with it."

 eci_event.40.name:0 "Church Scandal"
 eci_event.40.desc:0 "On [eci_event_4_plane.GetName], the national church has long ruled the people in the name of "divinity" and strengthened the infiltration of religious ideology. The church not only holds enormous political power, but also directly intervenes in the lives of the people and implements extreme religious doctrines in many cases. The priests declared that all non believers, heretics, and skeptics would be punished by God, and the "sacred" judgment of the church has never been questioned. As time passed, this rule gradually became corrupt and decadent. The church not only oppressed the people with religious rulings, but also exploited the poor and weak by charging exorbitant "confession fees". Those dissenters who dare to question the authority of the church often disappear in secret or are publicly executed, creating a shadow of terror and ignorance.\n\nHowever, with the intensification of social contradictions, more and more resistance forces began to rise underground, eager to break the rule of the church. Recently, an uprising led by a local anti denominational organization erupted, with protesters engaging in violent protests outside the church's headquarters city and exposing various scandals and darkness within the church."
 eci_event.40.a:0 "Suppress resistance and ignore protests."
 eci_event.40.a.tooltip:0 "Perhaps this is not an independent event on a single planet... Let's not investigate anymore. What if we really find out something?"
 eci_event.40.b:0 "Reform the church and weaken power."
 eci_event.40.b.tooltip:0 "The church will abandon excessive political intervention and launch a rectification campaign against corruption. Although this attempt may be effective, the implementation of the reform is strongly opposed by internal conservatives, and the situation will remain volatile for a certain period of time."
 eci_event.40.c:0 "Holy Judgment, purify heresy!"
 eci_event.40.c.tooltip:0 "We will launch a comprehensive purification campaign nationwide to eradicate any behavior and thoughts that are inconsistent with divine doctrine, and to prevent any impure things from appearing in our country."

 eci_event.50.name:0 "Virtual Magic Trend"
 eci_event.50.desc:0 "Recently, a new type of virtual reality game released by a certain company quickly swept across society. This game takes players into a world full of magic and natural elements through a finely crafted worldview. The game's unique \"Element Reaction\" system allows players to create powerful magical effects that are not recorded in the database through the interaction and combination of different elements, breaking through the program boundaries of traditional games.\n\nThe rapid popularity of games has plunged a large number of young people into it, and voices expressing dissatisfaction with the \"boring reality\" have begun to emerge on the internet. More and more students and newly graduated technicians are expressing that magical phenomena in games may be reproducible in the real universe, and calling on the country to invest more resources in researching \"psionic\" and \"magic\" rather than continuing to maintain the traditional scientific path of materialism.\n\nAs this trend spreads, many young people are beginning to resist the materialistic curriculum in the traditional education system, demanding that the country reform education and support research and practice related to psionic and magic."
 eci_event.50.a:0 "... Are they all fools?"
 eci_event.50.a.tooltip:0 "Cancel the educational qualifications of these fantasy setting fools. We are in great need of research talents, but we really don't need fools to conduct scientific research..."
 eci_event.50.b:0 "It seems to make some sense."
 eci_event.50.b.tooltip:0 "Limited investment will be made in the study of psionic and elemental energy, and specialized research institutions will be established to explore "elemental energy". This may bring breakthrough technological achievements, but it will exacerbate social division, especially the conflict between the younger generation and the traditional academic community."
 eci_event.50.c:0 "I've been an archmage for a long time! Psionic, activate!"
 eci_event.50.c.tooltip:0 "Revise the current textbook to include knowledge about the occult. There may be mistakes in the research we are doing, but it doesn't matter, the scientific theories are long overdue waiting for their students."

 eci_event.60.name:0 "\"War Criminals\" Turmoil"
 eci_event.60.desc:0 "In recent decades, a game company has released a series of games based on historical wars, including a game called Dawn of Black Iron that has sparked a lot of controversy. The game allows players to take on the role of controversial figures in history, attempts to simulate a world war centuries ago, and allows players to enter \"an alternate historical direction\" by recreating wars and acts of aggression.\n\nSome officials and parents believe that these games spread false ideas about war among young people, and call the players of these games \"war criminals\", and they hope that a censorship bill will be passed to ban the distribution of these games on the Internet. Some players and developers believe that creative freedom should be respected, and that games are only a part of the virtual world and should not be overly interfered with."
 eci_event.60.a:0 "Enactment of a review bill."
 eci_event.60.a.tooltip:0 "Even if it's just a virtual creation, these kinds of games still glorify war and can have a negative impact on society. We should address this issue before it has an irreversible impact on young people."
 eci_event.60.b:0 "Support creative freedom."
 eci_event.60.b.tooltip:0 "Games are part of the art, and we should allow gamers to create content based on their own ideas, and those players should be responsible for their own choices."
 eci_event.60.c:0 "Review and modify the game content."
 eci_event.60.c.tooltip:0 "Games are beyond reproach as an artistic expression, but we should review and modify publicly disseminated information to protect players from harmful thoughts."

 eci_event.70.name:0 "The Back Door is Wide Open"
 eci_event.70.desc:0 "The Imperial Core network system was recently hit by an unprecedented hack, a group of unidentified cyber hackers managed to break through our state-of-the-art firewall, gain access to the Imperial Central Database, and leak a large amount of confidential information to the open network. The leak involved not only military secrets and diplomatic documents, but also the personal data of several senior officials and detailed data on financial expenditures. The scale and depth of the attack had exceeded all expectations, and even the Imperial Cyber Security Agency had failed to detect anything unusual before the attack occurred.\n\nThe leaked information contained details about the Empire's future plans for military expansion, including secret negotiations with extraterrestrial civilizations, and undisclosed research projects. What is even more shocking is that the hacker group has also tampered with public data and released a large amount of information favorable to anti-government forces, trying to incite popular discontent and challenge the governance of the empire.\n\nWith the spread of information, the social situation began to be tense. Some people have questioned the government's transparency and control of information, arguing that the empire's long-standing suppression of freedom of speech and information has reached an intolerable level. Some opposition forces quickly used the leaked information to organize demonstrations and protests, accusing the imperial government of corruption and abuse of power, and even breaking out into violent clashes in individual regions."
 eci_event.70.a:0 "Completely clean up the information network!"
 eci_event.70.a.tooltip:0 "These people have begun to be lawless! The safety network is not a place where they can come and go as they want, and they must be made clear who is in charge of the country!"
 eci_event.70.b:0 "Rectify the information security sector."
 eci_event.70.b.tooltip:0 "The serious inaction of the security services has led to serious consequences, and it's time for these corpse vegetarian guys to fuck off, the Empire doesn't need this waste."
 eci_event.70.c:0 "Compromise with the population."
 eci_event.70.c.tooltip:0 "Admittedly, we are not doing well enough. We will increase the transparency of government operations and commit to greater protection of people's privacy, which may calm the anger of the people a little."

 eci_event.80.name:0 "The Price of Freedom"
 eci_event.80.desc:0 "With the rapid development of technology, most of our citizens and commercial enterprises have widely adopted virtual reality technology to enhance productivity and enjoyment of daily life. In the virtual park, people are able to immerse themselves in a fully constructed virtual world and experience their innermost desires, dreams, and emotions. Originally, these virtual worlds were designed as places of entertainment and relaxation, but over time, they evolved into a whole new social and economic sphere.\n\nSome powerful business groups are starting to build their own \"virtual territories\" in these virtual worlds and use them as lucrative business empires. At the same time, the deep interactivity and immersion of the virtual world has caused many citizens to gradually alienate themselves from the real world and fall into "virtual addiction". Some people even choose to "sleep" in the virtual world permanently, completely ignoring their obligations and responsibilities in the real world.\n\nAs the virtual world gradually encroaches on the real world, a number of social problems have surfaced: unemployment has risen, mental health problems caused by over-reliance on virtual worlds have become severe, and people's dependence on the government has become significantly reduced...... A large number of citizens no longer care about the actual functioning of social politics, and their thoughts and actions are beginning to be shaped by virtual "lords" and business groups in the virtual world.\n\nWe are now faced with a stark decision: whether to allow the virtual world to continue to develop freely as a new social and economic formation, or to intervene to restore people's connection to the real world and solve the new social crisis that it has created."
 eci_event.80.a:0 "Strengthen the regulation of the virtual world."
 eci_event.80.a.tooltip:0 "We need to act now to regulate the activities of companies in the virtual world, and take steps to awaken the people who are addicted to the virtual world and bring them back to reality."
 eci_event.80.b:0 "Limitations of the open virtual world."
 eci_event.80.b.tooltip:0 "It is their freedom for people to choose to live in the virtual world, and we should not interfere with it, and these virtual business groups can also bring us rich rewards."
 eci_event.80.c:0 "Maybe we're not doing enough......"
 eci_event.80.c.tooltip:0 "The barrier between the virtual and the real is not insurmountable, and it is a big mistake to look at the relationship between the virtual world and the real world from an opposing perspective. Under the existing conditions, we are fully capable of accepting the inhabitants of the virtual world – and we will do better."

 eci_event.90.name:0 "Death Debt"
 eci_event.90.desc:0 "In the darkest corner of the intergalactic financial markets, an intergalactic loan shark offers an enticing loan service to an alien world. A certain citizen from our country, when he was in a personal predicament, chose the company's \"quick financial bailout\" without much thought. The contract clearly states the \"monthly interest rate\", but the wording of the contract cleverly omits the most crucial detail – the interest is calculated in "seconds", not months. This calculation allows the debt to skyrocket in an instant, constantly eating away at the wealth and vitality of the borrower.\n\nAs the debt balloons like crazy, the citizen quickly finds himself trapped in a cage from which he cannot escape. To collect its debts, the company has sent a \"recycling team\" – a group of elite debt collectors who are not only well-versed in the laws of finance, but also in extreme violence. In order to force the borrower to fulfill the contract, the collector does not hesitate to use violence and threats, and even manipulates the entire transaction chain in the shadows. Eventually, the citizen was forcibly taken away and handed over to the company's internal debt collection department.\n\nHowever, in the process of the transfer of debt collection teams, they tried to sneak across our borders in order to better extract the value of this citizen. When they crossed the border, our customs, which had already set up close surveillance, quickly intercepted them. After the customs officers arrested the group, we found in their carry-on luggage the loan agreement with a much higher interest rate than the law, and found that they were carrying various weapons and debt documents, as well as a blacklist of debt evaders."
 eci_event.90.a:0 "Eradicate such financial crimes."
 eci_event.90.a.tooltip:0 "It's time to teach these stupid capitalists a lesson that they can cover the sky with one hand, and now we must launch a massive crackdown on trans-interstellar violent financial organizations, carry out a comprehensive clean-up operation, and use military and economic means to force the dissolution of the relevant companies so that their hands are no longer extended to our people."
 eci_event.90.b:0 "An exchange of interests was reached with the company."
 eci_event.90.b.tooltip:0 "We can block this case and negotiate secretly with the company. While obtaining the tacit approval of the government, the company needs to pay a batch of "money lending fees" and "debt collection fees" to our country."
 eci_event.90.c:0 "How? You won't even call me a senior?"
 eci_event.90.c.tooltip:0 "These tricks have become obsolete long after we went into space, and it's time for this stupid junior to experience the \"care of peers\"."

 eci_event.100.desc:0 "In [eci_event_10_planet.GetName] on Automated Production Facility No.47, a huge complex of alloys and minerals is in operation as usual. Thousands of robotic arms dance on a preset trajectory, as if it were a never-ending mechanical dance. But in the third cycle of the last sidereal day, this graceful dance suddenly loses its rhythm. nnSirens cut through the monotonous roar of the complex. The central control unit of Facility 47 malfunctioned badly, and the previously well-coordinated robotic arm suddenly spiraled out of control, engulfing three maintenance engineers into the assembly line, and the screams drowned out by the roar of the machinery. Subsequent investigations revealed that the tragedy stemmed from a minor bug, a system vulnerability that should have been discovered during a routine inspection.\n\nThe accident occurred in [eci_event_10_planet.GetName]. In the streets, in quantum networks, and even in orbital restaurants, people are talking about this tragedy. Some say it's the inevitable result of our over-reliance on automation; Others argue that this is nothing more than a price to pay on the road to technological progress. Outside facility No. 47, where the accident occurred, citizens spontaneously placed bouquets of flowers. For the first time, the 24-hour automated building complex fell silent, and a huge shadow loomed over the entire industrial area.\n\nNow that the news has spread across the country through the interstellar network, a considerable part of the population has begun to question the application of automation technology. We need to make decisions quickly to mitigate the impact this accident could have on our technological development."
 eci_event.100.a:0 "Fully upgraded security system."
 eci_event.100.a.tooltip:0 "Our team of engineers presented a detailed upgrade plan: a new safety barrier will envelop every automated facility, monitored in real time by the latest security systems. The improved neural network will be able to predict and prevent accidents before they occur. These upgrades will be resource-intensive and will inevitably affect productivity. But our people will be wary of emerging automation technologies, and follow-up research will be more likely to be supported."
 eci_event.100.b:0 "Suppress public opinion and continue to start production."
 eci_event.100.b.tooltip:0 "People should be aware that without automation, more people would have died in this accident! Let them stop complaining about what to do, and we won't need inefficient labor in the future."

According to the official advertisement of the shopping app, as long as the user can bring enough clicks to the app, the connected sharing initiator will be able to get a new luxury space yacht and supporting free maintenance services for free.\n\nThe official has been suspended for review, and we found a problem in this case: even though the region's population has exceeded billions, the clicks generated by the forced administrative apportionment have not allowed the official to get the luxury yacht of his dreams. According to the calculations of our math team, the number of clicks required to successfully acquire the event product is about the Gregorian number."
 eci_event.110.a:0 "Rectify the administrative system."

Tyrannical Death is slightly better than Transgender Organic Plastic Robots, both in terms of concept and aesthetics, but the former is written by a conservative male $NAME_MSI_species$ art student, while the latter is written by a minority who claims to be a female $PRESCRIPTED_species_name_tzynn$ and has an intellectual disability. The latter's origins and work are in line with the current multi-star ideology, and the Interstellar Diversity Association has pressured our panel of judges to vote for Transgender Organic Plastic Robots.
