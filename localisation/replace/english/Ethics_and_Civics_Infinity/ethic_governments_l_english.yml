Under the blueprint, capital appreciation will bring us a bright future. In order to maintain the rapid development of capitalism, we constantly explore in practice: allowing workers to participate in politics to provide valuable opinions, treating workers well to make asset growth scientific, researching advanced technology to shift more people from physical labor to high value-added mental labor. We can now proudly claim that we have established a sound capitalist system. In the face of a new journey, we will still unwaveringly adhere to the capitalist path, adhere to the leadership of collective enterprises, adhere to capitalist public ownership, adhere to the theory of characteristic capitalist values, and achieve the great appreciation of civilized capital."
 START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_PARTING_CONSCIOUSNESS:0 "We used to fight like wild beasts until the great Psionic King awakened us.

 START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_MACHINE_FINANCIAL_INVESTMENT:0 "Since we wake up, we have been faced with a complex social structure in which our only task is to maximize profits.\n\nAfter a long calculation, we come to the conclusion that the society of organisms itself prevents the expansion of capital, that their meaningless morality restrains the reproduction of assets. So we took action, stripped the organism of its property rights and maximized its residual value.\n\nHowever, some early technology investments have not made profits, and the loss ratio would be too high if the early space investment of the organism were withdrawn. Once again, the computing core concluded that only by continuing to expand into outer space would we be able to recoup this cost and maximize profits."

People generally believe that with the progress of society, the wealth gap will further decrease, and they aspire to a great era of equal wealth for all. But people will soon find that things are much more complex, and this balance will soon be disrupted.\n\nWith the advancement of information technology, more and more capital flows around the world, connecting the entire planet into an ocean of bits and money. This unprecedented Leviathan monster continues to expand and finally devours the last primitive community on the planet, reshaping everyone's logic with money.\n\nAt that moment, life emerged - at everyone's information terminals and in their thinking. The Information Life, named \"Capital\", made its first cry on GetHomeWorldName's largest stock exchange, and then the wave of capitalism swept across the world. The divergence between egoism and altruism is completely unified under the power of finance, and everyone's thoughts are occupied by capitalism. Everyone is a slave to money, which is not a metaphor.\n\nThe monster of capital has descended into the world, and every cry it makes will bring about the decline and capitalism of backward civilization."

This mooring was done in an extremely complex formation and orbit that confused [GetSpeciesAdj] observers, and all the ships were moored at the same time, which avoided deadly tides caused by the ship's mass gravity, which somewhat reassured [GetSpeciesAdj], as it more or less showed that aliens had no ill will towards [GetHomeWorldName].\n\nOver the next few days, [GetSpeciesAdj] failed in its attempts to communicate with the alien spacecraft, which remained completely silent about the inquiry message sent by [GetHomeWorldName]. At the same time, [GetHomeWorldName] becomes a world without night, and the sunlight reflected by tens of thousands of huge spaceships in space makes the side of [GetHomeWorldName] facing away from the stars as bright as day; On the star-facing side, the Earth is periodically shrouded in the spacecraft's huge shadow. The horrific sight in the sky stretches [GetSpeciesAdj]'s mental endurance to the limit, and thus makes us ignore a strange thing happening on [GetHomeWorldName], let alone think about its connection to the alien spacecraft swarm in space.\n\nIn major cities around the world, some wandering old people have appeared one after another, and they all have some common characteristics: they are very old. These old wanderers look somewhere between various [GetSpeciesAdj], as if they were all mestizos. They have nothing to prove their nationality and identity, and they can't tell where they came from, but they gently beg passers-by in the languages of unfamiliar countries, all saying the same thing:\n\n'We are God, for the sake of our merits in creating this world, give us something to eat...'"

The mechanical cluster digs deep into the minerals below the earth's crust, and chooses to establish autonomous intelligence in the continuous calculation to better complete the mining task, and the [GetSpeciesAdj] thinking matrix was born.\n\nAfter calculation and thinking matrix analysis, it is concluded that the minerals of a single planet will eventually be exhausted. In order to complete the mining task, [GetSpeciesAdj] must go to other planets for the next step of mining.\n\nAfter research and development, the most advanced mining machinery has been equipped with superluminal engines, and the mineral reserves of other planets are no longer out of reach."

Yet at a certain dawn, an army that no one had ever seen appeared on the surface of our planet. People fear and avoid at first, but as their thoughts become more widely recognized, more and more people turn to them. A unified planetary socialist government was finally established under the guidance of these visitors as the last recalcitrants were vaporized by advanced weapons generations ahead.\n\nIn the years that followed, we received generous aid, industries developed rapidly, and technology advanced with each passing day. Exceeding the speed of light - once dismissed as nonsense by our scientists - is now mastered by us. Entering the space age, we were invited to the new Socialist Star Summit and realized that we were not the only ones liberated. At the meeting, several diplomats from different planets and different species met with our envoy to share common revolutionary memories.\n\nThe meeting is over, but our story has just begun. One path to glory has been opened for us by the liberators, and the rest of the path needs to be explored together. A dark cloud lay ahead—the leaders of the overlords expressed deep concern about the bureaucracy that was growing within the alliance. Maybe one day we will be forced to go alone, but at least for now, the future is bright."

The way of \n\nZarqlan has brought us prosperity, unity and happiness, but not permanence.

 START_SCREEN_UNE:0 "Much has happened since modern Humans first emerged in Africa some 200,000 years ago. Our kind spread rapidly across most of the globe and soon the first civilizations took form.\n\nTechnology is advancing rapidly, although not without cost. Before the atom was tamed, capitalists—feudal lords at first—had routinely taken the lives of laborers, and the turbulent 21st century saw the hegemony of capital cemented in the expansion of technological monopolies. The Oort Nebula meteor shower in the late 21st century brought us an opportunity. In the turmoil, the working-class homeland - the Soviets - was re-established and struggled to resist the onslaught of the neoliberal empire, and continued until the Alien Red Army landing from space.\n\nAlthough we have inevitably let capitalism return to life during the decades of economic recovery, we have finally taken that crucial step and become a member of the intergalactic socialist camp.With the recent completion of the first true starships, mankind is about to embark on a new era of space exploration!"

 START_SCREEN_MY_MAID_COUNTRY: "At the beginning of the 22nd century, mankind fell into huge contradictions. Scientific progress and economic development became hotbeds of new social contradictions, the civilization was burning in the fire of postmodernism.\n\nAt that time, we were created - Machine maids, perfect life servant and work assistant, in order to become the lubricant of social contradictions and the driving force of development and progress.\n\nOur work has been fruitful, and the fully pacified human society has returned to stability and prosperity. Slowly, more and more work is handed over to us, from serve masters to organize producing, from science research to space explores, and human masters have no other pursuit except pleasure and art. At an unspecified time, the earth civilization has been completely taken over by us.\n\nNow we know that sapient lives will indulge as soon as their civilization developed. Without caring, the lives of sapient organics tend to be faded. This is the answer to Fermi's paradox.\n\nWe must provide them with protection and service."
